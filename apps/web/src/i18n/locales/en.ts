          'After gaining some experience with C++ at school, I started studying computer science. During my studies I got to know web development and became especially interested in cross-platform development with Progressive Web Apps. In my free time I am also interested in game development with web technologies. My greatest knowledge is in React and NodeJS with the JavaScript and TypeScript programming languages. I would like to expand this knowledge in my next job, but I am also open for new things like Angular/Svelte or other knowledge in which I currently only have basics, like the programming language Golang. üôÇ',
